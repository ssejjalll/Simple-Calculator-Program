Simple Calculator Program:
Hey there! Welcome to my Simple Calculator Program. This is a straightforward command-line calculator built with Python that lets you perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It’s designed to be user-friendly and easy to understand, making it perfect for anyone just starting out with programming.

How to Use: Using the calculator is super simple, Just follow these steps:
1. Run the Program: Start by executing the Python script.
2. Enter Your Numbers: You’ll be prompted to input two numbers.
3. Choose an Operation: Pick what you want to do—add, subtract, multiply, or divide.
4. See Your Result: The program will show you the result of your calculation.
